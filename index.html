                        If you have never had pasta with caramelized onions, now is the time to try it. My favourite variation includes panfried tomato paste, sun-dried tomatoes, and a dash of soy sauce - big sources of umami flavour. Top the pasta with parsley tossed in lemon juice and smoked farmer cheese, to give it even more flavor and zing!
